## Hello there!  

I'm Lars, a 21 year old computing nerd from Germany.
You might also know me by one of a couple nicknames. [^alias]
In the last couple years, I have mostly been going by "luatic" online.

[^alias]: e.g. "appguru[eu|lars]" or "LMD"

### Programming

A lot of my life revolves around programming.

Due to a lucky coincidence, I started to learn programming relatively early,
by making little 2d video games in Python.
Since then, programming and related activities have become the thing I spend most of my time on.
I've now programmed for well over a decade.

More broadly, all things computing interest me, especially programming language design and implementation,
including niche or esoteric programming languages.

I like learning new languages and tools if they genuinely have new ideas to offer.
Over the years, I have picked up many languages and tools for different purposes.
At this point, I can get up to speed in a new "mainstream" language relatively quickly.
The languages I have used so far include

* C++, C, Zig
* Java, Golang, Dart
* Python, PHP, JavaScript, Lua

Among them, Lua resonates with me the most: I find it hits the sweet spot where it is simultaneously very simple and useful.
Other programming languages may be more useful, or more simple, but I'm yet to find a language that is both. [^lua]

[^lua]: For some examples of Lua's elegance, you can check out this [collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Lua](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Lua). I also expect to publish some blog posts on various aspects of Lua's design.

### Formal education

I have a Bachelor in Computer Science from the University of Bonn.
My interests are relatively broad. As a general theme, in my studies, I try to get out of my comfort zone,
focusing more on the theoretical parts, especially algorithmics,
as well as the combination with practical optimizations for real-world problems.
(This is often called "algorithm engineering".)

### Hobbies

Don't worry, I do also enjoy things outside of the computer!
Currently I play beach volleyball for fun.
I'm not very good at it yet, but I hope to be decent one day.
I also like reading. Occasionally I play chess.
I am always happy to meet new people!

### Links

* You can follow most of my free software development activity [on my GitHub account](https://github.com/appgurueu).
  Many of my projects are related to the [Luanti](luanti.org) voxel game platform.
  Nowadays, I am mostly active as a Luanti core developer, writing engine code mostly in C++.
* You can find my old Luanti mods on [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/users/LMD/).
  I also have a [forum account](https://forum.minetest.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&un=LMD),
  but I do not follow what goes on actively anymore.
* I used to answer programming questions [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7185318/lmd).
  I am still happy to explain programming concepts or help with problems, but I'm not active on StackOverflow anymore.

### Bloarg

The site name is not a typo. "Bloarg" is a portmanteau of blog, [blag](https://xkcd.com/148/) and blarg.
And maybe bloat if you wish. Simply a place for me to share my writings with you.

### Contact

If you want to reach out to me, perhaps the simplest way is to shoot me an email at [appgurulars@gmx.de](mailto:appgurulars@gmx.de).

You can also contact me on Discord, username `luatic`, or [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@luatic).
