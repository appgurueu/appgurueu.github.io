Hi, I'm Lars. I like Lua.
You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/appgurueu).
Many of them are related to the [Minetest](https://minetest.net) game platform.
I also maintain a [Lua algorithm repo](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Lua).
I'm also on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7185318/lmd).

This blog was made using Jekyll since it allows me to focus on the contents
rather than going down the rabbit hole of reinventing the wheel
both in terms of static site generators and Markdown parsers.
The resulting website is bland,
but for how quick Jekyll gets you up to speed it is worth it.

It may be replaced by something more unique (& written in pure Lua, of course)
eventually when I find the time to reinvent the wheel.
